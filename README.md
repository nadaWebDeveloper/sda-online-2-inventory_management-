## Level 3 - *Extra feature: Complex functionalities*
`Class Store` should have extra features
- [x] ~~`Method SortByDate` to get the sorted collection by date dynamically (asc or desc)~~

###  items example

<p>

```c#
 // method invocation example - You do not need to follow exactly the same
`var store = new Store(300)`
// ... add all items to the store
`var collectionSortedByDate = store.SortByDate(SortOrder.DESC)`
// print all items
...
```

    Console.WriteLine($"{group.Key} Items:");
    foreach (var item in group.Value) {
        Console.WriteLine($" - {item.Name}, Created: {item.CreatedDate.ToShortDateString()}");
    }
}
